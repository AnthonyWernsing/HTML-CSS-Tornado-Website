            <br />
            Television - Allows for slightly easier communication between a large group of people

            Maps/Radars - Allows for quick and easier understandment of storms
            <br />

            * Doppler Radar - Shows velocity and reactivity of storms
            <br />
            * Hook Echo - Shows a "hook" on the storm that indicates strong rotation
            <br />
            * Debris ball - Has a different color on the hook of a hook eco. Debris balls are debris in the atmosphere, usually caused by tornados
            <br />
            * Hail core - Shows a 3D image of updrafts. The higher chance of hail, usually means higher chance of tornados
            <br />
            * Rain wall - Usually surrounds a tornado. These walls can make it very diffcult to see through, making the tornado invisible to the human eye
            <br />

            <br />
            * Rope
